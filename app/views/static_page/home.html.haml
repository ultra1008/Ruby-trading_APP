      The Local Trading app combines the benefits of the traditional e-commerce websites along with online marketplaces. Online marketplaces like FB marketplace do not handle privacy very well and websites like craigslist uses very bad design as it was built when front end rendering was costly. If you can sell it on AMAZON or Craigslist or anywhere else, you can sell it on the local trading app.
